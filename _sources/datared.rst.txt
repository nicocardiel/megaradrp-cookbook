Data reduction
**************

Getting Started
===============

The first step to start the data reduction is to activate your
environment (see details in section :ref:`DRP_installation`).

The next step is to download the data employed in this cookbook: 
`megara-cookbook-v2.tar.gz
<https://guaix.fis.ucm.es/data/megaradrp/megara-cookbook-v2.tar.gz>`_

If you find any trouble trying to download the previous file, try with the
following command line:


.. code-block:: console

    (megara) $ curl -O https://guaix.fis.ucm.es/data/megaradrp/megara-cookbook-v2.tar.gz

.. warning::

   Please be aware that this file has been updated as of September 2024.  This
   change has been motivated by the need to adapt the structure of the
   ``control.yaml`` file to facilitate the EMIR reduction pipeline in handling
   data obtained with a detector different from the one originally installed.
   This type of change requires the use of specific calibration files for the
   particular detector used at any given time. Once this file is modified for
   EMIR, MEGARA also inherits the same change (the different pipelines use the
   same Python package **numina** as the reduction launcher). The modification
   of the control.yaml file is not backward compatible, so it is necessary to
   have a recent version of megaradrp installed.

It is advisable to decompress the previous file in a pristine directory where
you can comfortably start the reduction of the data:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ tar zxvf megara-cookbook-v2.tar.gz
   (megara) $ cd megara-cookbook-v2
   (megara) $ source INSTALL.sh

The last command simply replaces the second line of the file
``MEGARA/control.yaml`` to set the proper directory where the cookbook data
have been deployed.

Data organization
=================

MEGARA DRP uses its own data organization to work. 

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ tree -L 2
   .
   ├── INSTALL.sh
   └── MEGARA
       ├── M15_LCB_HR-R
       ├── M71_MOS_LR-R
       ├── ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48
       └── control.yaml

Note that the ``tree`` command shown above might not be available in certain
unix distributions (you can use `ls` instead).

Under the ``MEGARA/`` directory we need to have the calibration tree with
the specific name ``ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/``, which is the
string that uniquely identifies the instrument configuration (a
different name was, for example, used during laboratory integration at
LICA-UCM). Under the ``MEGARA/`` directory we can also have the requirements
file named ``control.yaml`` needed to run the pipeline (see section
:ref:`Running_a_recipe`).

The requirements file ``control.yaml`` contains the path for your ``MEGARA/``
directory (second line of this file; keyword ``rootdir``),
and useful information for performing the wavelength calibration of each
VPH, including the number of arc lines and
degree of polynomial fit to be used by the wavelength calibration
recipe. In this file you can also specify the name for the extinction
curve file used for the flux calibration recipe. This is simply an ASCII
file with two space-separated columns, one with the wavelength in
Angstroms and another with the magnitudes of extinction per unit airmass
at the corresponding wavelength, i.e. the same format used for
extinction curves within IRAF. We strongly recommend to use the standard
extinction curve of the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (file
``extinction_LP.txt`` under the ``data`` subdirectory; see below).

.. literalinclude:: files/control.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

Another fundamental function of the calibration tree
(``ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/``) is to host the calibration
products that will be used by the corresponding recipes, such as the
**MasterBias**, **MasterFiberFlat**, **MasterSensitivity**, etc. Thus, once the
files for these calibrations are generated, they should be copied under
this calibration tree according structure below. Since the DRP would
read the first file in alphabetical order inside the corresponding
folder, we recommend to place only one file in each folder.

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ tree -L 2 ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48
   ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48

The content for the LinesCatalog/ is specific for each VPH (line lists
for all VPHs can be found at
https://zenodo.org/record/2270518). In the following
example the calibration files for the HR-R (LCB observing mode) and LR-R
(MOS observing mode) VPHs are shown. When other VPHs are used, the user
just needs to create the corresponding folders. It is recommended to
have only one file in each calibration directory. For example, for the
same VPH you can have several ``master_traces.json`` files with the
information to trace the fibers light through the detector at the same
day but at different ambient temperatures.

Different files can be stored at the same directory, but the DRP is
going to use the first file it encounters in alphabetical order. The
user can name the desired file with prefix ``00_`` (e.g.
``00_master_traces.json``) to be sure this is the file to be used by the
DRP. Note that the sorting of files named ``00_`` and ``000_`` might
be different for the operative system and for the MEGARA DRP, so avoid
making abusive use of these prefixes.

An example of calibration tree with some additional calibration files is the
following:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ tree ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/ -L 4

Furthermore, the user’s ``MEGARA/`` directory can contain data for your
targets under different directories (in this example our targets are the
M15 and M71 globular clusters). **Your raw data should always be
included in a subdirectory named** ``data/`` within each working target
directory (M15, M71, etc.). Images could be stored gzipped but then the
observation-result files should list the images with the .gz extension.
The different observation-result files (``*.yaml``) used during the data
reduction process should be also located within each target directory as
they will be different for each target. In this example, the
observation-result files in YAML format are named with a first number
related in which order they are run.

.. _Running_a_recipe:

Running a recipe
================

The MEGARA DRP is run through a command line interface provided by
**numina**.

.. note::

   Remember that the ``numina`` script is the interface with GTC pipelines. 
   In order to execute **megaradrp** recipes you should type something like:

   ::
   
      (megara) $ numina run <observation_result_file.yaml> -r <requirements_file.yaml>

   where ``<observation_result_file.yaml>`` is an observation result file in 
   YAML format, and ``<requirements_files.yaml>`` is a requirements file, also 
   in YAML format (this file is named ``control.yaml``).

   YAML is a human-readable data serialization language (for details see 
   `YAML Syntax
   <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html>`_)


The run mode of ``numina`` requires:

-  An observation-result file in YAML format.

-  A requirements file in YAML format (``control.yaml``).

-  The raw images obtained as part of the user’s observing block.

-  The calibrations required by the recipe.

The observation-result file and the requirements file are created by the
user. This is an example of the observation result file to compute the
fibers traces ``1_TraceMap.yaml`` under the subdirectory ``M15_LCB-HR-R``:

.. literalinclude:: files/1_TraceMap.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

The ``id:`` is an identifier of the observing block. The DRP will
create two directories with the products of the recipe (``obsid<id>_work/`` and
``obsid<id>_results/``) using the ``id`` identifier as an arbitray label to 
identify
the corresponding processing block. The ``mode:`` is the name of the
instrument observing mode as returned by numina show-modes. In
``frames:`` a list of the names of the images obtained as part of the
observation should be included. 

Using the same YAML file the user can process sequentially different sets of
files with the same recipe. For that purpose, the ``enabled:`` parameter can be
set to *True* (or *False*) to process (or not) a specific block of files. In
this case, do not forget the separation line ``---`` between blocks (otherwise
the pipeline will not recognize where one block ends and the next one begins).
This separation line must not appear after the last block.
Note that the user can add comments to these YAML files by adding lines
preceded with a hash sign (``#``).

An example of an observation-result file with two blocks is the following:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ more 1_TraceMap.yaml
   id: 1_TraceMap_HR-R
   mode: MegaraTraceMap
   instrument: MEGARA
   frames:
    - 0001312246-20170831-MEGARA-MegaraSuccess.fits
    - 0001312247-20170831-MEGARA-MegaraSuccess.fits
    - 0001312248-20170831-MEGARA-MegaraSuccess.fits
   enabled: True
   ---
   id: 1_TraceMap_HR-R_d29jun
   mode: MegaraTraceMap
   instrument: MEGARA
   frames:
    - 0001252371-20170629-MEGARA-MegaraFiberFlatImage.fits
    - 0001252372-20170629-MEGARA-MegaraFiberFlatImage.fits
    - 0001252373-20170629-MEGARA-MegaraFiberFlatImage.fits
   enabled: True

In the directory of our target M15 we have already defined several
observation-result files (``*.yaml``):

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ pwd
   /Users/janedoe/megara-cookbook-v2/MEGARA/M15_LCB_HR-R
   (megara) $ ls
   0_Bias.yaml             3_WaveCalib_check.yaml  7_StandardStar.yaml
   1_TraceMap.yaml         4_FiberFlat.yaml        8_LcbImage.yaml
   2_ModelMap.yaml         5_TwilightFlat.yaml     data/
   3_WaveCalib.yaml        6_LcbAdquisition.yaml
   

If we want to run the recipe **MegaraTraceMap** using the observing-result file
``1_TraceMap.yaml``, with the requirements file ``control.yaml`` (the latter
located in the directory above the current one), we should execute:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 1_TraceMap.yaml -r ../control.yaml

When disk space is an issue, it is possible to execute ``numina`` indicating
that links (instead of actual copies of the original raw files) must be placed
in the ``obsid<id>_work/`` subdirectory. This behaviour is set using the
parameter ``--link-files``:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 1_TraceMap.yaml --link-files -r ../control.yaml

*Note:* in recent versions of ``numina`` this is no longer necessary since the
default behavior assumes ``--link-files``.

Other useful **numina** commands include:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina show-modes

   (megara) $ numina show-recipes

   (megara) $ numina show-recipes -m <obs mode>

   (megara) $ numina run -h

   (megara) $ numina run 1_TraceMap.yaml -r ../control.yaml –enable <block_id>


.. _Data_reduction_process:

Data reduction process
======================

In the following sections the different steps to produce the target
wavelength and flux calibrated row-stacked spectra (RSS) are detailed. The
examples are illustrated making use of the cookbook data available for the
target M15:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ pwd
   /Users/janedoe/megara-cookbook-v2/MEGARA/M15_LCB_HR-R

You can easily examine the header of the FITS images using the astropy utility
``fitsheader``:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ fitsheader -k VPH -k INSMODE -k OBJECT -k SPECLAMP -k EXPTIME -k DATE-OBS \
              -f -e 0 data/*.fits
                            filename                          VPH  INSMODE  OBJECT SPECLAMP EXPTIME        DATE-OBS

The data available include bias exposures (the VPH is not relevant here),
halogen exposures (for tracing and flatfielding), ThNe arc exposures (for
wavelength calibration), and target exposures.

Bias image
~~~~~~~~~~

Before the Analog-to-Digital conversion is performed a pedestal
(electronic) level is added to all images obtained with the MEGARA CCD.
This is a standard procedure in CCD imaging and spectroscopy
applications for Astronomy and is intended to minimize the ADC errors
produced when very low analog values are converted to DUs. To calibrate
this pedestal level of the detectors, bias images are taking with null
integration time. We note the user that in the case of the MEGARA CCD (a
4k x 4k pixels CCD231-84 E2V chip), since the detector is always read
using two diagonally-opposed amplifiers (to speed up the reading process
while minimizing electronic cross-talk), the bias is slightly different
in the upper and bottom halves of the image. Note that the Readout Noise
(RoN) should be around 2 e\ :sup:`–` in all cases.

This recipe processes a set of bias images obtained in Bias Image
instrument mode. Images are corrected from overscan and trimmed to the
physical size of the detector. Then, they are corrected from Bad-pixels
Mask, if the BPM is available and finally, images are stacked using the
median.

The content of the file ``0_Bias.yaml`` for the M15 data is the following:

.. literalinclude:: files/0_Bias.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

The recipe is run as follows,

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 0_Bias.yaml -r ../control.yaml

and the products are stored in the directory ``obsid0_Bias_results/``,
including the ``master_bias.fits`` file (see **Figure 4**).

**Figure 4:** Example of a MEGARA master bias as created by the
**MegaraBiasImage** recipe. Note that this image was obtained with the
MEGARA DRP ver. 0.9. Later versions fit a spline to the overscan regions of
both amplifiers (instead of adopting a constant value) so the resulting image
is typically flatter than the example shown here.

The user needs to copy the file ``master_bias.fits`` to the calibration tree at
``ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/MasterBias/``:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ cp obsid0_Bias_results/master_bias.fits \
              ../ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/MasterBias

Dark image
~~~~~~~~~~

The potential wells in CCD detectors spontaneously generate electron-ion
pairs at a rate that is a function of temperature. For very long
exposures this translates into a current that is associated with no
light source and that is commonly referred to as dark current. Different
tests during AIV activities have shown MEGARA detector´s dark current
has very low values < 2 e\ :sup:`-`/h/pixel, therefore in our data
reduction dark images are neither needed nor used.

Bad-pixels Mask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although science-grade CCD detectors show very few bad pixels / bad
columns there will be a number of pixels (among the ~17 Million pixels
in the MEGARA CCD) whose response could not be corrected by means of
using calibration images such as dark frames or flat-field images. These
pixels, commonly called either dead or hot pixels, should be identified
and masked so their expected signal could be derived using dithered
images or, alternatively, locally interpolated. The user is provided
with a Bad-Pixels Mask (BPM) named ``master_bpm.fits`` and located at
``ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/MasterBPM/`` that was generated as
part of the AIV activities by processing a set of defocused continuum
flat images. This image can be also found at
https://zenodo.org/record/2270518. Currently, MEGARA
presents only one (partial) bad column of 120 pixels in length.

Slit Flat correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the case of fiber-fed spectrographs the correction for the detector
pixel-to-pixel variation of the sensibility is usually carried out using
data from laboratory, where the change in efficiency of the detector at
different wavelengths is computed and then used to correct for this
effect for each specific instrument configuration (VPH setup in the case
of MEGARA).

The quality of present-day CCDs leads to a rather small impact of these
pixel-to-pixel variations in sensitivity on either the flux calibration
and the cosmetics of the scientific images, especially considering that
not one but a number of pixels along the spatial direction are extracted
for each fiber and at each wavelength. In the case of MEGARA, the
pseudo-slit has been offset from its optical focus position to ensure
that the gaps between fibers are also illuminated when a continuum
(halogen) lamp at the ICM is used. The results of the analysis of the
pixel-to-pixel variations in sensitivity show that this correction is
actually not needed although this recipe is implemented in the MEGARA
DRP.

.. _Tracing_Fibers:

Tracing fibers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trace map
^^^^^^^^^

The next processing step combine a series of fiber-flats to generate a
master trace map. The fiber-flats are obtained by illuminating the
instrument focal plane with a continuum (halogen) lamp that is part of
the GTC Instrument Calibration Module (ICM).

This step produces the tracing information required to extract the flux
of the fibers. The result is stored in a file named
``master_traces.json``.

An example of the observation result file ``1_TraceMap.yaml`` to trace the
fibers is the following:

.. literalinclude:: files/1_TraceMap.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 1_TraceMap.yaml -r ../control.yaml

Images listed in the observation-result file are trimmed and corrected
from overscan, bad-pixel mask (if ``master_bpm.fits`` is present in the
calibration tree), bias and
dark current (if ``master_dark.fits`` is present). Images thus corrected are
then median stacked. The result of the combination is saved as an
intermediate result that is named ``reduced_image.fits``. This
combined image is also returned in the field ``reduced_image`` of the
recipe result and will be used for doing some quality control on the
tracing of the fibers.

The fibers are then grouped in packs of different numbers of fibers. To
match the traces in the image with the corresponding fibers, the DRP
uses the information provided by the instrument configuration to know
how fibers are packed and where the different groups of fibers appear in
the detector. Using the column reference 2000, peaks are detected (using
an average of 7 columns) and matched to the layout of fibers. Fibers
without a matching peak are counted and their ids stored in the final
``master_traces.json`` file. Once the peaks in the reference column are
found, each one is traced until the border of the image is reached. The
trace may be lost before reaching the border. In all cases, the
beginning and the end of the trace are stored.

The Y position of the trace is fitted to a polynomial of degree
polynomial_degree set to 5 by default. The coefficients of the
polynomial are stored in the final ``master_traces.json`` file.

.. code-block:: console

   master_traces.json  reduced_image.fits  result.json
   processing.log      reduced_rss.fits    task.json

The position of the fibers traces at the detector are shifted depending
on the ambient temperature. It is recommended to have continuum halogen
exposures near in time to the observation of the scientific target. If
this is not the case, the traces can be shifted easily when processing
the target (see below).

The traces generated by this task can be visualized both on the raw or
the processed images and can be also shifted to consider possible
offsets between these traces and the position in the fibers in other
images (twilight flats, standard star or scientific target observations,
etc.). The visualization of the traces and an underlying reduced image
can be done by executing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ megaradrp-overplot_traces \ 
              obsid1_TraceMap_HR-R_results/reduced_image.fits \
              obsid1_TraceMap_HR-R_results/master_traces.json

It is also possible to overplot the traces in the original raw data, making
using of the additional parameter ``--rawimage``:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ megaradrp-overplot_traces --rawimage \
              data/0001312246-20170831-MEGARA-MegaraSuccess.fits \
              obsid1_TraceMap_HR-R_results/master_traces.json

respectively for the reduced and raw images. Another way to check the
tracing is by overplotting the **ds9** region files created by the DRP for
the traces on top of this ``reduced_image.fits`` by doing (syntax might vary):

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ ds9 obsid1_TraceMap_HR-R_results/reduced_image.fits \
              -regions load obsid1_TraceMap_HR-R_work/ds9.reg

The same syntax can be used to check the offset between these traces and
the position of the fibers in other images (arc-lamp, twilight, standard
star and object images).

Finally, the user needs to copy this ``master_traces.json`` to the
corresponding place at the calibration tree. In this case, this trace map
corresponds to the VPH HR-R (LCB mode):

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ cp obsid1_TraceMap_HR-R_results/master_traces.json \
              ../ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/TraceMap/LCB/HR-R

Model map
^^^^^^^^^

This recipe processes a set of continuum flat images obtained in *Trace
Map* or *Fiber Flat* modes and returns the fiber profile information
required to perform **advanced** fiber extraction in other recipes.

The set of files listed in the observation-result file ``2_ModelMap.yaml``
is the same one used for the Trace Map.

.. literalinclude:: files/2_ModelMap.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 2_ModelMap.yaml -r ../control.yaml

This processing step might take several minutes (from 10-40 min.)
depending on the hardware used. When a model map is used the running
times of the subsequent processing steps also increase by 2-5 minutes.

The images are processed as in the Trace Map recipe. In this case, the
approximate central position of the fibers is obtained from the
previously computed ``master_traces.json``. Then, for every 100 columns of
the reduced image, a vertical cut in the image is fitted to a sum of
fiber profiles, being the profile a gaussian convolved with a square.
After the columns are fitted, the profiles (central position and sigma)
are interpolated to all columns using splines (see **Figure 5**). The
coefficients of the resulting splines are stored in the final
``master_model.json`` file.

|image8|\ |image9|

**Figure 5:** Mean position (left) and sigma (right) in pixels for fiber
#310 along the spectral axis shown as blue points. The red line shows
the spline fit. Plots for all the fibers are stored in the
``obsid2_ModelMap_HR-R_work/`` subdirectory.

The recipe also returns the RSS obtained by applying this advanced
extraction to *reduced_image*. As an intermediate result, the recipe
produces DS9 region files with the position of the center of the
profiles, that can be used with raw and reduced images (see **Figure
6**).

.. _Wavelength_Calibration:

Wavelength Calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this processing step the wavelength solution for each fiber is
created using recipe **MegaraArcCalibration**. To create the dispersion
solution the recipe needs raw arc-lamp frames as input (see **Figure 7**). Note
that although the term used is "arc-lamps" these are ThAr and ThNe
Hollow-Cathode Lamps (HCL).

.. image:: _static/image15.png
   :width: 5.0in

**Figure 7:** MEGARA LCB ThNe arc-lamp exposure obtained with the HR-R
VPH.

The user needs to check if the traces already computed in the previous step are
appropriate to do the extraction in the arc-lamp exposures. If the continuum
halogen used to generate the traces and the arc-lamp images were obtained near
in time there no offset should be applied to the traces. By taking the images
close in time user ensures that temperature remains constant so no offset is
present. The offsets are estimated to be ~1 pixel per ºC/K of change in
temperature. No offset in the spectral direction has been reported.

The user can check this and evaluate the actual offset
by plotting the ``ds9_raw.reg`` regions file on top of the arc-lamp raw
image using DS9. If the traces (regions in ``ds9_raw.reg``) are above the
fiber as seen in the raw image, then the offset is a negative number and
it is measured in pixels, while if the traces are below then the offset
is a positive number. This offset is given in the ``requirements``
section in the observation-result file using the ``extraction_offset``
parameter.

In this case, the observation-result file is called ``3_WaveCalib.yaml``.
In the example below, three frames for arc lamp exposures are included
and the offset for the extraction is set to 0 pixels:

.. literalinclude:: files/3_WaveCalib.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 3_WaveCalib.yaml -r ../control.yaml

Images provided in ``3_WaveCalib.yaml`` are trimmed and corrected from
overscan, bad-pixel mask (if ``master_bpm.fits`` is present in the calibration
tree), bias and dark
current (if ``master_dark.fits`` is present). The corrected images are then
stacked using a median. The result of the combination of these images is
saved as an intermediate result, named ``reduced_image.fits``. The
apertures in the 2D image are extracted, using the information in
``master_traces.json`` (or in the ``model_map.json`` if this file is present
at the calibration tree) and the ``extraction_offset`` parameter set in
the ``3_WaveCalib.yaml``. The result of the extraction is saved as an
intermediate result named ``reduced_rss.fits``. The requirement file
``control.yaml`` has useful information for the wavelength calibration.
For each fiber in the reduced RSS, the peaks are detected and sorted by
peak intensity. Then, a total of *nlines* as listed in the
``control.yaml`` file are used to select the brightest peaks. If it is a
list, then the peaks are divided, by their position, in as many groups
as elements in the list, and ``nlines[0]`` peaks are selected in the first
group, ``nlines[1]`` peaks in the second, etc. The selected peaks are then
matched against the catalog of lines located in the calibration tree at
``ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/LinesCatalog/``. The wavelengths of
the matched features are fitted to a polynomial of degree equal to
``polynomial_degree``. The matched lines, the quality of the match and
other relevant information such as the coefficients of the polynomial
are stored in the final ``master_wlcalib.json`` for each fiber.

Finally, the recipe returns different products. At the
``obsid3_WaveCalib_HR-R_work/`` directory the files ``wavecal_iter1.pdf`` (for
the initial wavelength calibration) and ``wavecal_iter2.pdf`` (for the final
iteration) contain a graphical representation for the wavelength calibration
for each fiber.  For example, in ``wavecal_iter2.pdf`` the total number of
lines used for the refined wavelength calibration and the root mean square for
each fit is plotted depending on the fiber number. In the same PDF file, the
linear approximation for CRVAL1 and CDELT1 is plotted and also a graph for each
coefficient (typically of 5\ :sup:`th` degree) of the polynomial fit used for
the refined wavelength calibration is shown (see **Figure 8**).

After the previous procedure, a refinement of the wavelength calibration is
performed by fitting a polynomial to the variation of each coefficient of the
wavelength calibration polynomial against the fiber number. Fibers whose
wavelength calibration polynomial does not fit the expected smooth variation of
the coefficients are automatically detected. In such cases, an interpolated
polynomial is used, which provides very good results. The results of this
refinment are graphically stored in the file ``wavecal_refine_iter1.pdf``.

   :height: 4.14792in

**Figure 8:** Some of the plots included in the ``wavecalib_iter2.pdf`` file
generated with the **MegaraArcCalibration** recipe.

Should the user set the ``store_pdf_with_refined_fits`` parameter to
``store_pdf_with_refined_fits: 1`` at the ``3_WaveCalib.yaml``, the recipe will
create the subdirectory ``obsid3_WaveCalib_HR-R_work/refined_wavecal/`` where a
collection of PDF files (one for each fiber) is created with graphical
information about the refined wavelength calibration (see **Figure 9**).

case) is generated when the parameter ``store_pdf_with_refined_fits`` is
set to 1. This requirement should be set to 0 for a faster execution of
this recipe.

              ../ca3558e3-e50d-4bbc-86bd-da50a0998a48/WavelengthCalibration/LCB/HR-R

To quickly check the wavelength calibration, it is possible to apply the newly
calculated calibration to the arc image itself. To do this, we can reduce the
arc exposures as if they were scientific exposures. We carry out this task
using the **MegaraLcbAcquisition** recipe. In this example, we execute this
task using the file ``3_WaveCalib_check.yaml``.

.. literalinclude:: files/3_WaveCalib_check.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

Note that the images to be reduced correspond to the 3 individual arc
exposures. Among the requirements, we are using ``master_fiberflat:
master_fiberflat_ones.fits``, a special FITS file located in the data
subdirectory that contains a fictitious flatfield image where all values are
set to 1.0. For the wavelength calibration check, we do not need to use a
correct master fiberflat image.

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 3_WaveCalib_check.yaml -r ../control.yaml

The image to be examined is
``obsid3_WaveCalib_check_HR-R_results/reduced_rss.fits``. In this image, all
the arc line must appear as perfectly vertical lines.

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina-ximshow obsid3_WaveCalib_check_HR-R_results/reduced_rss.fits

.. image:: _static/arc_reduced_rss.png
   :width: 6.5in

Flat-field correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each optical fiber in MEGARA behaves like a different optical system,
and therefore, its optical transmission is different and individual,
with different wavelength dependence.

The recipe **MegaraFiberFlatImage** computes the ``master_fiberflat.fits``
to correct for the global variations in transmission in between fibers
and as a function of wavelength in MEGARA. A fiber-flat image should be
used to perform this correction. These images are obtained by means of
illuminating the instrument focal plane with a flat spectral source
(typically a halogen lamp) that is installed as part of the GTC
Instrument Calibration Module (ICM).

In this case, we called the observation result file ``4_FiberFlat.yaml``,
where a total of three continuum halogen exposures are included:

.. literalinclude:: files/4_FiberFlat.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

If the inputs frames are the same used to trace the fiber spectra on the
detector for the same specific spectral setup, the ``extraction_offset``
parameter should be set to 0 pixels. If that is note the case the offset should
be evaluated and computed as detailed in Section :ref:`Wavelength_Calibration`.

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

  (megara) $ numina run 4_FiberFlat.yaml -r ../control.yaml

All images listed in the observation-result file are trimmed and corrected from
overscan, bad pixel mask (if ``master_bpm.fits`` is present in the calibration
tree), bias and dark current (if ``master_dark.fits`` is present) and corrected
from pixel-to-pixel flat if ``master_slitflat.fits`` is provided. The corrected
images are then stacked using a median. The result of the combination is saved
as an intermediate result, named ``reduced_image.fits``.

The apertures in the 2D image are extracted, using the information in
``master_traces.json`` (or in the ``model_map.json`` if this file is present
at the calibration tree) and the ``extraction_offset`` parameter set in
the ``4_FiberFlat.yaml``, and then it is resampled according to the
wavelength calibration in ``master_wlcalib.json``. The resulting RSS is
saved as an itnermediate result named ``reduced_rss.fits``. To normalize
the ``master_fiberflat``, each fiber is divided by the best-fitting spline
to the average of all valid fibers (see **Figure 10**). The RSS image
``master_fiberflat.fits`` is returned as a recipe result (see **Figure
11**).

spectral in order to generate the normalized master_fiberflat image.

Illumination correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blank twilight-sky exposures are to be used to calibrate the global
change in response introduced by the fiber flat. This is called the
illumination correction and it is due to the fact that the GTC ICM does
not produce a perfectly uniform illumination of the field and that the
fraction and shape of the pupil that is seen by the MEGARA fibers during
the observation of a specific target does not coincide with that seen
during the acquisition of the fiber-flat images with the ICM.

The twilight sky exposure can safely assume to homogeneously illuminate
the entire MEGARA field of view (3.5 arcmin x 3.5 arcmin for MOS mode
and 12.5 x 11.3 sq. arcsec for LCB mode). However, since the telescope
pupil is not circular and the alignment of the image of the pupil on top
fibers by the microlenses is not identical for all fibers, in order to
do this correction properly, the Rotator Angle of the FC-F rotator
(ROTANG keyword in the raw image) and the Elevation of the telescope
(ELEVAT keyword), and ideally also the temperature, should have the same
values as the ones for the scientific observation. Furthermore, in case
of MOS observing mode, the twilight sky exposures should be done with
the robotic positioners placed at the same positions as for the targets’
configuration.

The recipe **MegaraTwilightFlatImage** process a set of continuum blank
twilight sky images and returns the master twilight flat product. In
this case, we named observation result file as ``5_TwilightFlat.yaml``, where
three frames for continuum blank twilight sky exposures being listed in
the file:

.. literalinclude:: files/5_TwilightFlat.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

The ``extraction_offset`` parameter can be computed as
detailed in section :ref:`Wavelength_Calibration` (see **Figure 12**).

   :height: 2.375in

**Figure 12:** Example of a region in the raw blank twilight sky image
(LCB, HR-R) with the computed traces (``ds9_raw.reg`` file) on top. In this
case a ``extraction_offset`` of +2.5 pixels was needed.

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 5_TwilightFlat.yaml -r ../control.yaml

Images provided in the observation-result file are trimmed and corrected
from overscan, bad pixel mask (if ``master_bpm`` is present), bias and
dark current (if ``master_dark`` is present) and corrected from
pixel-to-pixel flat if ``master_slitflat`` is provided. The corrected
images are then stacked using a median. The result of the combination is
saved as an intermediate result, named ``reduced_image.fits``.

The apertures in the 2D image are extracted, using the information in
``master_traces.json`` (or in the ``model_map.json`` if this file is present
at the calibration tree) and the ``extraction_offset`` parameter set in
the ``5_TwilightFlat.yaml``, and then it is resampled according to the
wavelength calibration in ``master_wlcalib.json``. Then, the result is
divided by the ``master_fiberflat``. The resulting RSS is saved as an
intermediate result named ``reduced_rss.fits``. To normalize the
``master_twilightflat`` (see **Figure 13**), each fiber is divided by
the average of the column range given in ``normalize_region``
parameter in ``5_TwilightFlat.yaml``. In those cases where the observation of
an object includes a bright sky line, this ``normalize_region``
parameter can be used to obtain a twilight flat image from these science
observations, especially if twilight frames of the same ROTANG, ELEVAT
and temperature values are not available. In that case, the user can
also make use of the parameter ``continuum_region`` to previously
subtract the sky continuum under the bright sky line of interest. Note
that the pixels used in the ``normalize_region`` and the
``continuum_region`` requirements correspond to those of the x-axis
of the ``reduced_rss.fits`` image.

Flux calibration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The flux calibration is performed by observing one or several
spectrophotometric stars with the same instrument configuration that for
the scientific observations. Depending on the number of standard stars
observed and on the weather conditions (mainly transparency) two
different types of calibration could be achieved:

-  Absolute-flux calibration: The weather conditions during the night
   should be photometric and a number of spectrophotometric standard
   stars at different airmasses should be observed. This allows to fully
   correct from DUs per CCD pixel to energy surface density (typically
   in AB magnitudes, Jankys or erg s\ :sup:`-1` cm\ :sup:`-2`
   Å\ :sup:`-1`) incident at the top of the atmosphere. If only one
   single standard star is observed (ideally at the airmass of the
   science object) this correction allows deriving the energy surface
   density hitting the telescope primary mirror exclusively, unless an
   atmospheric extinction curve for the observatory and that particular
   night is assumed (in which case the airmass could be different). In
   order to properly flux-calibrate scientific observations at all
   airmasses several stars should be observed during the night.

-  Relative-flux calibration: If the weather conditions are not
   photometric this correction only allows normalizing the DUs per CCD
   pixel along the spectral direction so the conversion to incident
   energy at the top of the atmosphere is the same at all wavelengths.
   In order for this calibration to be valid one must assume that the
   effect of the atmosphere (including atmospheric cirrus and possibly
   thick clouds) on the wavelength dependence of this correction is that
   given by the adopted atmospheric extinction curve, even if the
   absolute flux level is not.

In the following, the different steps to do an absolute flux calibration
are described. A photometric night and one spectrophotometric standard
star observation with the same airmass as the scientific observation are
assumed.

The entire flux of the spectrophotometric standard star needs to be
recovered, so the LCB IFU bundle must be used. The recipe
**MegaraLcbAcquisition** is used to process and extract the spectra in the
standard star observation and determine the position of the centroid of
the target in the LCB field of view, around which the total flux of the
star will be later recovered.

In this case, the observation-result file for determining the star
centroid is ``6_LcbAdquisition.yaml``, where three frames for
spectrophotometric standard star exposures are here listed:

.. literalinclude:: files/6_LcbAdquisition.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

The ``extraction_offset`` parameter can be computed as detailed in section
:ref:`Wavelength_Calibration`.

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 6_LcbAdquisition.yaml -r ../control.yaml

Images provided in observation-result file are trimmed and corrected from
overscan, bad pixel mask (if ``master_bpm.fits`` is present in the calibration
tree), bias and dark current (if ``master_dark.fits`` is present) and corrected
from pixel-to-pixel flat if ``master_slitflat.fits`` is provided. The corrected
images are then stacked using a median. The result of the combination is saved
as an intermediate result, named ``reduced_image.fits``.

The apertures in the 2D image are extracted, using the information in
``master_traces.json`` (or in the ``model_map.json`` if this file is present
at the calibration tree) and the ``extraction_offset`` parameter set in
the ``6_LcbAdquisition.yaml``, and then it is resampled according to the
wavelength calibration in ``master_wlcalib.json``. Then it is divided by
the ``master_fiberflat.fits``. The resulting RSS is saved as an intermediate
result named ``reduced_rss.fits``.

The sky is subtracted by combining the 56 fibers dedicated for this
purpose in the LCB mode. The RSS with sky subtracted is saved in a file
named ``final_rss.fits`` as a result of the recipe. Then, the centroids
around both the center of the field and the brighest spaxel are computed
using up the signal from the 3 rings of fibers (37 fibers in total)
around these two spaxels. The offsets needed to center the object
(considered to be either the centroid around the central spaxel or, more
likely, around the brightest spaxel) in the center of the LCB field are
then returned both in mm and arcsec. This information is saved in the
``processing.log`` file at the ``obsid6_LcbImage_HR-R_result/`` directory.

In this example, the brighest spaxel is located at ``[0.38366336928735895,
0.0] mm`` relative to the center of the field, which is, by definition
located at ``[0.0, 0.0] mm``. The position of the centroid obtained from
the 37 fibers around this spaxels is ``[0.29712138659120624,
0.04342557311038363] mm``. **Note**: these numbers depend on whether you are
using the trace map ``master_traces.json`` or the model map
``master_model.json`` (see section :ref:`Tracing_Fibers`).

This centroid offset (in mm) is needed to recover all the flux from the
standard star and to derive the instrument sensitivity curve for a particular
setup using the **MegaraLcbStdStar** recipe.

In this case, the observation-result file was named
``7_StandardStar.yaml`` and includes spectrophotometric standard star
individual exposures:

.. literalinclude:: files/7_StandardStar.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

The ``extraction_offset`` parameter can be computed as detailed in section
:ref:`Wavelength_Calibration` (this parameter is the same as in
``6_LcbAdquisition.yaml`` for the same spectrophotometric standard star). The
parameter ``reference_spectrum`` includes a text file where the flux-calibrated
spectrum in AB magnitudes is provided.  (the format of these files is the same
as for those found in the ESO spectrophotometric standard stars database
located at this `ESO web page
<https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/tools/standards/spectra/>`_). This
parameter can be also specify in the ``control.yaml``. The
``reference_extinction`` parameter points to the text file with the information
to apply the atmospheric extinction correction.  (for processing standard-star
observations this parameter must be defined in either the ``control.yaml`` of
``7_StandardStar.yaml`` files or the recipe would fail; in the case of the
**MegaraLcbImage** or **MegarMosImage** recipes this would only imply that the
processed data would not be corrected for atmospheric extinction).

By default, the DRP searches for these data files in the
``data/`` directory.  The ``position`` parameter is the position of the
reference object, i.e.  the offset in mm at the CCD detector computed with the
recipe **MegaraLcbAcquisition**, written in the same format and units. Finally,
the ``sigma_resolution`` parameter is the sigma of the Gaussian filter that
would be used to degrade the resolution of the MEGARA input star spectrum.
Given the high spectral resolution and low reciprocal dispersion of the MEGARA
spectra this parameter is critical to remove artifacts associated to bright
absorption lines present in the standard star spectrum, especially when the
tabulated spectra have reciprocal dispersions that can be as high as 50
Å/pixel. The parameter ``ignored_sky_bundles`` contains the fiber bundle ids to
be ignored when the sky spectrum is computed (see more details in section
:ref:`Scientific_Observation` below).

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 7_StandardStar.yaml -r ../control.yaml

Images provided in the observation-result file are trimmed and corrected from
overscan, bad pixel mask (if ``master_bpm.fits`` is present in the calibration
tree), bias and dark current (if ``master_dark.fits`` is present) and corrected
from pixel-to-pixel flat if ``master_slitflat.fits`` is provided. The corrected
images are then stacked using a median. The result of the combination is saved
as an intermediate result, named ``reduced_image.fits``.

The apertures in the 2D image are extracted, using the information in
``master_traces.json`` (or in the ``model_map.json`` if this file is present
at the calibration tree) and the ``extraction_offset`` parameter set in
the ``7_StandardStar.yaml``, and then it is resampled according to the
wavelength calibration in ``master_wlcalib.json``. Then, the result is
divided by the ``master_fiberflat.fits``. The resulting RSS is saved as an
intermediate result named ``reduced_rss.fits``.

The sky is subtracted by combining the 56 fibers dedicated for this purpose in
the LCB mode. The RSS with the sky already subtracted is saved in a file named
``final_rss.fits`` as a result of the recipe. The flux of the star is computed
by summing the signal in 37 fibers around the spaxel closest to the offset
given in the ``position`` parameter so, finally, the ``star_spectrum.fits`` is
returned. This star spectrum is degraded with a Gaussian filter, corrected by
atmospheric extinction and compared with the reference spectrum to return the
``master_sensitivity.fits``, which is finally stored at the
``obsid7_StandardStar_HR-R_result/`` directory.

**Figure 14:** Example of sensitivity curve for MEGARA HR-R VPH. The
spectral ranges defined by keywords WAVLIMM1-2 and WAVELIMF1-2 are shown
as cyan and dashed brown lines, respectively (see text for details).

The user needs to copy the file ``master_sensitivity.fits`` to the calibration

It is worth noting that the ``master_sensitivity.fits`` file includes on
its header the information on the spectral ranges that are valid in
terms of spectral coverage both in pixels and wavelength for all, ranges
covered in at least one fiber (PIXLIMR1-2 and WAVLIMR1-2), all fibers
(PIXLIMM1-2 and WAVLIMM1-2) and with a proper flux calibration
(PIXLIMF1-2 and WAVLIMF1-2) (see **Table 2**). The latter range is
limited by the degree of smoothing applied to the sensitivity curve. The
WAVLIMM1-2 and WAVELIMF1-2 ranges are shown in **Figure 14** using cyan
and dashed brown lines, respectively.

.. _Scientific_Observation:

LCB IFU/MOS scientific observation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all the calibrations files are derived and copied at the
corresponding calibration directories, the user can reduce the
corresponding scientific observations with recipes **MegaraLcbImage** or
**MegarMosImage** depending on the observing mode (the LCB IFU or the
MOS).

In this case, the observation-result files are named ``8_LcbImage.yaml`` for
the LCB and ``8_MosImage.yaml`` for the MOS mode, and include a list of all
the frames obtained for the target. The ``extraction_offset`` parameter can be
computed as detailed in section :ref:`Wavelength_Calibration`.  The
``reference_extinction`` parameter can be provided here if it is not at the
``control.yaml`` file. The parameter ``ignored_sky_bundles`` contains the sky
bundle ids to be ignored when the sky spectrum is computed (see sample .yaml
file below). In the case of LCB observing mode, the dedicated sky-bundles have,
by default, all ids in the range 93-100.  These bundles (sorted in blocks of
seven consecutive fibers) correspond to the individual fiber ids and position
on the sky (for instrument PA set to zero, i.e. NE) listed in Table below.

+----------+---------------------------+-------------+---------------+
|Sky-bundle| Sky-fibers ids in each    | On-sky      | Distance to   |

**Table 3:** Sky bundles: The first column identifies the sky-bundle id,
while the second column indicates which fibers (listed by fiber id) are
included in each sky bundle. The orientation (for an instrument Position
Angle of 0º; i.e. NE) and distance to the LCB center of each bundle is
included in the third and fourth columns, respectively.

In case MOS observing mode, sky-bundles should have been previously
selected by the user for that purpose when preparing the observation
with FMAT tool. If no sky-bundles are identified the DRP will not
perform any sky subtraction to the target data.

The content of the ``8_LcbImage.yaml`` file would be the following:

.. literalinclude:: files/8_LcbImage.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :linenos:
   :lineno-start: 1

Then the recipe is run by doing:

.. code-block:: console

   (megara) $ numina run 8_LcbImage.yaml -r ../control.yaml

Images provided in the observation-result file are trimmed and corrected
from overscan, bad pixel mask (if ``master_bpm.fits`` is present in the
calibration tree), bias and
dark current (if ``master_dark.fits`` is present) and corrected from
pixel-to-pixel flat if ``master_slitflat.fits`` is provided. The corrected
images are then stacked using a median. The result of the combination is
saved as an intermediate result, named ``reduced_image.fits``.

The apertures in the 2D image are extracted, using the information in
``master_traces.json`` (or in the ``model_map.json`` if this file is present
at the calibration tree) and the ``extraction_offset`` parameter set in
the ``8_LcbImage.yaml``. These are then resampled according to the
wavelength calibration in ``master_wlcalib.json``. Then, the result is
divided by the ``master_fiberflat.fits``. The resulting RSS is saved as an
intermediate result named ``reduced_rss.fits``.

The sky is subtracted by combining the 56 fibers (except the fibers
listed in the ``ignored_sky_bundles`` parameter) dedicated for this
purpose in the LCB mode. In case MOS observing mode, the sky is
subtracted combining the signal of the fiber bundles (SKY bundles)
selected by the user when preparing the MOS observation. The RSS with
sky subtracted is saved in a file named ``final_rss.fits`` as a result
of the recipe.

If a ``master_sensitivity.fits`` is provided (optional), RSS products will be
flux calibrated. If ``reference_extinction`` is provided (optional),
``final_rss.fits`` and ``reduced_rss.fits`` will be extinction corrected.
Notice that ``sky_rss.fits`` is not corrected for extinction.

The user has also the option of running these recipes without performing
any flux calibration. In order to do that one can simply add the
following lines (shown highlighted below) in the corresponding YAML
file:
