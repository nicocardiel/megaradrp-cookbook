MEGARA data reduction cookbook
==============================

This webpage is an updated version of the original cookbook (dated 07/07/2020),
available in PDF format at this `zenodo link
<https://zenodo.org/records/3932063>`_. That document was prepared by África
Castillo Morales, Sergio Pascual Ramírez and Armando Gil de Paz.  As the
aforementioned document has become slightly outdated over time, we have decided
to move the documentation to this website that allows for easier updates.
Nicolás Cardiel López and Mario Chamorro Cazorla have also joined this task.

**We strongly recommend using the most up-to-date information available on this
webpage.**
